METHODOLOGY = """
**What this assessment does**

DIGCON examines how a concrete AI use can affect people and fundamental rights, what safeguards are available,
who is responsible, and whether the evidence supports the proposed decision. The DPIA provides a methodological
reference. The research framework can be used beyond the statutory scope of an individual assessment obligation.

**How to work through it**

1. Describe the system, its actual use, the people affected and the organisation’s responsibilities.
2. Explain which legal requirements apply. The provider risk management module and deployer FRIA have separate scopes.
3. Assess harm, involve affected people where relevant, and examine safeguards and legal constraints.
4. Address findings in the action plan, verify the evidence, and record the organisation’s reasoned decision.

**Law and DIGCON method**

[Article 9 AI Act](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-9) concerns the risk management system
for high-risk AI systems. [Article 27 AI Act](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-27) concerns
FRIAs by the deployers and for the uses within its scope. High-risk status or a joint role alone does not establish
that Article 27 applies. Each module explains the relevant paragraphs next to the questions.
The tool uses recorded applicability answers; it does not independently validate the legal classification or applicable dates.

The four risk dimensions, outcome categories, action records and review workflow are DIGCON methodological choices.
They are not statutory scoring rules. Use existing documentation where relevant, identifying the section and explaining
what it establishes in this context. A document reference is not, by itself, evidence of adequacy.

**From a finding to action**

Distinguish missing information, an established shortcoming, a risk of harm and a legal determination still needed.
Adding a missing document is an assessment task; changing a process to reduce harm is a mitigation measure.
Both may require action, but they serve different purposes.

Follow the four steps: understand the problem; plan the action; record implementation; verify and decide.
Explain why each measure addresses the particular problem. Identify the implementer, the effectiveness verifier
and the person deciding on that finding, including provider and deployer contributions where needed.
A proposed measure does not establish implementation; implementation does not establish effectiveness;
effectiveness does not automatically close a finding. Closure requires a specific reasoned human decision.

Reassess scale, scope, reversibility and probability separately, linking each proposed change to verified controls
and supporting evidence. Unverified residual values do not replace the initial risk. A confirmed legal stop condition
requires a new reasoned legal determination based on changed facts or safeguards; an action plan cannot override it.

**Reading the result**

Unknown, not applicable and information held by another actor are distinct from a negative answer.
Colours describe individual checks, not general permission to proceed. A valid audit trail means the recorded
reasoning can be traced; it does not establish completeness, adequacy or legality.
The tool’s outcome is a recommendation. The organisation records its governance decision and reasons separately.
